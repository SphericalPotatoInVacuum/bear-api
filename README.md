# Bear API
This is a project done to learn the concepts of REST API's. If you want to use it, then you should add config folder to hold configs for config module. Each should contain the url of the database host and the displayed application name, like this:
```
{
    "name": "Bear API",
    "database-host": "mongodb://localhost/Bears_API_Database"
}
```
